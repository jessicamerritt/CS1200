    We need a law requiring the immigration agency to publish all

    victim's own privacy.

<h3>No national identity cards</h3>
<p>
I'd like to make a list of countries that do not require a national
identity card, and have no plans to adopt one. If you live in or have
confirmed knowledge of such a country, please send email to rms at
gnu.org.

<p>
Here's my list of countries with no national ID cards
and no plans for one: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK,
the Philippines.
Australia's previous government tried to
institute national ID cards, but the Labor government dropped
the plan.</p>

<p>India has mostly finished imposing a national biometric ID number
in a grand act of oppression.
</p>

<p>Switzerland has national ID cards which are optional,
but they or some other government ID card are needed for some purposes.
<p>
Iceland doesn't have ID cards as such, but they
have ID numbers that citizens are forced to use frequently.
For example, the national ID number is often required to
rent a video or use a gym.
</p>

<p>
Denmark issues non-photo ID cards with a "person number", and many
services use this card to identify people.
</p>

<p>
Norway will impose a national
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Norwegian_citizens_now_required_by_law_to_give_their_fingerprint_to_the_police.html">biometric
ID card</a>.

<h3>Flight connections</h3>

<h3>The Lifelong Activist</h3>
<p>
People often ask how I manage to continue devoting myself to
progressive activism (such as the free software movement) for
years without burning out.  The best way I can answer is by
recommending a book, <a href="http://lifelongactivist.com">
The Lifelong Activist</a> by Hillary Rettig.

<p>I disagree with the book on one theoretical point in the last
part of the book: we shouldn't think of political activism as
<em>being</em> marketing and sales, because those terms refer to
business, and politics is something much more
important than mere business.  However, this doesn't diminish
the value of the book's practical advice about borrowing
techniques from marketing and sales.</p>
